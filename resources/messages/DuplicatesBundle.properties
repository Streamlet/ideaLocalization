  The inspection features quick-fixes that help you to set the size of detected duplicates, navigate to repetitive code fragments, and compare them in a tool window.\n\n\
  The inspection options allow you to select the scope of the reported duplicated fragments and set the initial size for the duplicated language constructs.\n\n\
  You can also configure the constructs that you want to anonymize in {0}.
